      // "The control of a bipedal system is a challenging and complex problem that requires a powerful solution. The method of Hybrid Zero Dynamics developed at the University of Michigan is one such solution. This paper details the complete implementation of the hybrid zero dynamics of a three-link biped through the development of the kinematics, dynamic modeling, and controller design. Using the zero dynamics of our derived model, we find an energy efficient gait design, and integrate the full dynamics with a PD controller. These results are then verified with a step simulation.",

       "This project primarily focuses on determination of plant health by calculating a parameter called ‘Normalized Difference Vegetation Index’ using the captured IR images from a sensing & navigation unit. The project is implemented using a NoIR (No-Infrared) camera for determining plant health. The aim of the project is to create a system for tracking health conditions of plants in indoor environments such as a greenhouse, lab, etc. The initial trial was performed in Northeastern University’s campus where both live and dead plants were scanned to test the NDVI results.",

     "Autonomous reconnaissance in a simulated disaster scenario. Specifically, when introduced into a closed but initially unknown environment, the system accomplishes the following: 1. Generate a complete map of the environment; 2. Locate any victims present in the environment. For the purposes of this exercise, the environment is represented using an occupancy grid map, and AprilTags are used as stand-ins for simulated victims. Our objective is to deploy a TurtleBot3 in an unknown environment filled with AprilTags at randoom locations in random poses. The TurtleBot must generate a comprehensive map of the area while also identifying and cataloguing all the AprilTags present, including their unique ID numbers and absolute poses relative to the generated map.",
