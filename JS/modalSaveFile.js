		"The goal of our project was to exploit weaknesses in current mobile computing standards and break through RSA encryptions using side channel attacks." +
		"With this information, we would attempt to develop means to guard against these attacks in the future to protect our private data." +
		"In this project, I implemented several versions of RSA encryption algorithms employing different optimization techniques. " +
		"This project exposed me to higher level computer science concepts and greatly expanded my understanding of C++. " +
		"Furthermore, I was introduced to Git, learned to work with linux terminals, and gained experience in developing code in as a team.</p>" +
