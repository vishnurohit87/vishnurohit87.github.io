      "The control of a bipedal system is a challenging and complex problem that requires a powerful solution. The method of Hybrid Zero Dynamics developed at the University of Michigan is one such solution. This paper details the complete implementation of the hybrid zero dynamics of a three-link biped through the development of the kinematics, dynamic modeling, and controller design. Using the zero dynamics of our derived model, we find an energy efficient gait design, and integrate the full dynamics with a PD controller. These results are then verified with a step simulation.",
